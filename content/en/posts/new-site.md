This website is built using several modern web technologies and services:

## Hugo Static Site Generator
The site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), one of the fastest static site generators available. Hugo allows me to write content in Markdown and automatically generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed for the website.

## Theme
I'm using the [M10c theme](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c) for Hugo, which I've customized to fit my needs. It provides a clean, minimalist design with:
- Responsive layout
- Dark mode by default
- Code syntax highlighting
- Multi-language support

## Hosting & Deployment
The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which provides:
- Free hosting
- Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Custom domain support

## Domain Management
The domain is managed through [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), which provides:
- Domain registration
- DNS management
- Email forwarding

## Features
Some key features of this setup include:
- Multi-language support (English, Spanish, and Basque)
- Fast loading times
- Minimal maintenance required
- Version control through Git
- Automated deployments
